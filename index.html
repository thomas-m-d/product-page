            <h1>Immanuel Kant and You!</h1>
            <p>Wondering what you can know, what you ought to do, or what you may hope for? Then Immanuel Kant is the product for you! After decades of research in KÃ¶nigsberg, the Kant treatment is the only one guaranteed to deliver:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synthesis</strong> of intuitions and concepts into meaningful thoughts. Remember, concepts without intuitions are empty and intuitions without concepts are blind!</li>
                <li><strong>Acting</strong> in accordance with the categorical imperitive. Universalize those maxims, treat humanity never merely as a means, and you'll be an autonomous legislator in the kingdom of ends in no time!</li>
                <li><strong>Creating</strong> art worthy of your inner genius through the power of aesthetic reflective judgment. Only then can you create beautiful or sublime works with subjective universal validity!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you've mastered all of this, there will be nothing stopping you from unlocking your full potential. You'll know what the human being truly is, becuase you you will be what the human being truly is!</p>
            <p class="fine-print">Note: Guarantee only valid on condition of reading the complete system, including the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgment</em>, the <em>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</em>, and the <em>Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals</em>. Final discretion concerning completeness is left to your local Kant distributor. Frequent use of Immanuel Kant has been known to cause the following symptoms: overthinking, long-windedness, jargon fatigue, pedantry, confusion to others, and in severe cases even confusion to oneself. Consult your philosopher if symptoms persist for longer than four months.</p>
